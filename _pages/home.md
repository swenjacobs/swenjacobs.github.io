I am a tenure-track faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://www.cispa.de) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. My main research interests are in formal verification and synthesis, with a focus on parameterized systems, and more recently on security properties in the presence of side channels.
