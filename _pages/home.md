I am a tenure-track faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://www.cispa.de) in Saarbrücken, Germany. My main research interests are in formal verification and synthesis, with a focus on parameterized systems, and more recently on security properties in the presence of side channels.

**December 2022:** Our work [*Synthesis of Distributed Agreement-Based Systems with Efficiently-Decidable Verification*](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.12400) (with Nouraldin Jaber, Christopher Wagner, Milind Kulkarni and Roopsha Samanta) has been accepted for publication at **TACAS 2023**.

**October 2022:** We will have a special issue of the **Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing** on [***Dependability and Scalability of Distributed Systems in the Presence of Faults and Security Threats***](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-parallel-and-distributed-computing/about/forthcoming-special-issues#dependability-and-scalability-of-distributed-systems-in-the-presence-of-faults-and-security-threats). Submission deadline is February 5, 2023.

**October 2022:** Mouhammad Sakr presents our joint work (with Marcus Völp) [*Automatic Repair and Deadlock Detection for Parameterized Systems*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03322) at [**FMCAD 2022**](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD22/accepted/) in Trento.
