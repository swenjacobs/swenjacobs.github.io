We have open positions for PhD students and Postdocs.

My group conducts research into formal techniques for obtaining provably correct systems, with a focus on component-based systems with a parametric number of components, and complex properties including security and real-time guarantees.
The techniques encompass formal verification, automatic synthesis/repair, as well as learning of systems and their properties.
Overall, our mission is to make it easier to obtain systems with reliable correctness guarantees.

A candidate for a position in my group must have a strong theoretical background, with experience and a keen interest in formal methods such as model checking, formal synthesis, or related topics.
Experience in distributed systems, automated reasoning, or techniques for learning formal languages is a plus.

If you are interested in a position, let me know at jacobs@cispa.de.
